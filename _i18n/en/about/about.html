    Constructors is a Full Service Web Engineering Bureau. We work
    together until there is nothing left to innovate.
  </b>
  In other words, you will need to bring one hell of an army to keep us
  from doing what we do best.
</p>
<p>
  Before Constructors became a fact, we worked together on web software
  projects for several years. <a href="http://www.oppas.nl/">Oppas.nl</a>
  and <a href="http://mediaklapper.nl/">Mediaklapper</a> are among the
  projects we worked on. Because we wanted to share the innovative
  chemistry between us, we founded Constructors.
</p>
<p>
  Nowadays we work on a great variety of projects, helping businesses
  succeed wherever we can.
</p>
<p>
  We strive to expand our projects into increasingly diverse markets in
  the near future. Data science, embedded systems and security.
