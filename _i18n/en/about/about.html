    Constructors is a Full Service Web Engineering Bureau founded to get things
    done.
  </b>
  We efficiently construct fitting software solutions for your business. We will
  help you apply these solutions and improve them where we can.
</p>
<p>
  Before Constructors became a fact, we worked together on web software
  projects for several years. <a href="http://www.oppas.nl/">Oppas.nl</a>
  and <a href="http://mediaklapper.nl/">Mediaklapper</a> are among the
  projects we worked on. Because we wanted to share the innovative
  chemistry between us, we founded Constructors.
</p>
<p>
  Nowadays we work on a great variety of projects, helping businesses succeed
  wherever we can. The size and complexity of your project doesn't matter. If
  it's a full project solution you're looking for, or just a helping hand, we've
  got your back.
</p>
<p>
  With our years of experience in both open source software like Ruby on Rails
  or Python/Django and Linux operations skills, we're sure we can help you
  achieve your goals.
