  <b>Do you want to pay us a visit? We'd be honored!</b> Our office is
  located right in the city center of Eindhoven. There's public transport
  nearby. Yes, that includes an airfield.

<p>
  Make sure to let us know by sending an email beforehand. We'll make sure
  there's somebody to talk to and something to drink.

  You can park your car for free in front of our office building. If you would
  rather use public transport;
  here's <a href="http://9292.nl/en/?to=eindhoven_paradijslaan-32">a nifty
  tool</a> to calculate your trip.
